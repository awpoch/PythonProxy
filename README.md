# PythonProxy

<p>
  I created 3 python scripts, a client, a proxy, and a server. The client sends a request to the proxy, 
  which parses the request (sperating/organizing the host, file path, and headers) and sends it to the server. 
  The server then replies to the proxy with the requested file and the proxy forwards it back to the client. 
  Any server can be used, the client just has to enter the address at the beginning.
